Hi there!

I'm an **software developer** (for now) with Finance and Economics background.
Started out as Financial Analyst at Yahoo and then moved to Germany for my
master's study. My first job in at an IaaS company inspired me to learn
programming. After years working at open source tech startups, I decided to take
a career break and commit more time on learning software development to be able
to contribute to open source in a more meaningful way.
