Hi there, this is **Pei**.

<br />

I'm a **product person who also enjoys coding**. Started out as a financial
analyst at Yahoo! in Taiwan and then moved to Germany in 2015 for my master's
study.

<br />

My first job in Germany at an IaaS company inspired me to use Linux and learn
programming. After years working at **open source** tech companies, I decided to
take a career break and commit more time on learning software development as I
wish to contribute to open source in a more meaningful way and get my hands
dirty to build things myself.

<br />

I enjoy building products with user experience in mind, solving all kinds of
problems, and learning new stuff. Especially, I enjoy working on developer
tools.
