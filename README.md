## Personal Website
The project started out as an exercise to practice building frontend with React and Tailwind. However, since my original website has several blog posts in written Markdown, I decided to eventually migrate to Astro. 


## Design
The color theme and general UI is inspired by Cyberpunk and the trending Neue Brutalism design with my own interpretation. 


## Approaches
- Vanilla version: pure HTML, CSS, and TypeScript
- React version: React components, React Router, and Tailwind CSS. 
- Final version: Astro with React and Tailwind integrations.
